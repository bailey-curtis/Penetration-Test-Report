# PenetrationTest Report
<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this assignment, you will record the activities you undertook in both modules of penetration testing against MegaCorpOne and your results, and you'll create a report to turn in to the CISO of MegaCorpOne. This report will be your Challenge deliverable.
Remember that the report is a very important part of an engagement, as it tells the story of your findings and how you discovered them. 
Even if you complete all objectives when performing an assessment, a poor report appears to the customer as though you conducted a poor-quality assessment.
This report will cover your activities across both penetration testing modules. We recommend that you fill the report out as you work to shorten the time outside class to complete it.
